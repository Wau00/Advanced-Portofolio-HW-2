# Advanced-Portofolio-HW-2

# Description
The Advanced CSS Portfolio is a project that recapitulates the most important elements of a website. To capture the users attention, the design must be attractive and interactive. 

The technology used in HTML and CSS, helped me to make an advanced personal portfolio showing some projects I have done and the ones to come. I made from scratch an interactive interface adding a brief introduction about my background, contact forms for potential employers and a downloadable resume. In addition,  dynamic effects with "::hover"  in CSS as well as transform and transition were crucial to create animated adjustments. Finally, the page was adapted for use in multiple resolutions on digital platforms.
